## Additional information, scripts and data of the research project on active ambrosia beetle fungus farming

Abstract:

Fungal cultivation is a defining feature for advanced agriculture in attine ants and fungus-farming termites. In the third, supposedly fungus-farming group, wood-colonizing ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae), an experimental proof for the effectiveness of beetle activity for selective promotion of their food fungi over others is lacking and farming has only been assumed based on observations of social and hygienic behaviors.

Here, we experimentally removed mothers and their offspring from young nests of the fruit-tree pinhole borer, Xyleborinus saxesenii (Scolytinae). By amplicon sequencing of bacterial and fungal communities of nests with and without beetles we could show that beetles are indeed able to actively shift symbiont communities. Although being consumed, the Raffaelea food fungi were more abundant when beetles were present while a weed fungus (Chaetomium sp.) as well as overall bacterial diversity were reduced in comparison to nests without beetles. Core symbiont communities were generally low diverse and there were strong signs for vertical transmission not only for the cultivars, but also for secondary symbionts. Our findings verify the existence of active farming, even though the exact mechanisms underlying the selective promotion and/or suppression of symbionts need further investigation.
