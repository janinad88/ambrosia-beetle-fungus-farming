## Additional information, scripts and data of the research project on active ambrosia beetle fungus farming

Abstract:
Fungal cultivation is a defining feature for advanced agriculture in fungus-farming insects
and has been repeatedly shown for ants and to a lesser degree also termites. Wood 
colonizing ambrosia beetles are closely associated with specialized food fungi. Since the 
19th century, active farming has been assumed for these beetles based on their social 
and hygienic behaviors. However, a proof of the effectiveness of beetle activity for 
selective promotion of their food fungi over others is unknown. Here, we experimentally 
removed mothers and their offspring from young nests of the fruit-tree pinhole borer, 
Xyleborinus saxesenii. By amplicon sequencing of bacterial and fungal communities we 
could show that in control nests, beetles are indeed able to actively shift symbiont 
communities. Although being consumed, the Raffaelea food fungi were more abundant 
when beetles were present while a weed fungus (Chaetomium sp.) as well as overall 
bacterial diversity were reduced in comparison to nests without beetles. Core symbiont 
communities were generally low diverse and there were strong signs for vertical 
transmission not only for the cultivars, but also secondary symbionts. Our findings verify 
the existence of active farming, even though the exact mechanisms underlying the 
selective promotion and/or defense of symbionts need further investigation.
