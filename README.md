## Additional information, scripts and data of the research project on active ambrosia beetle fungus farming

Abstract:
Active management of fungal cultivars is a criterion for advanced agriculture in fungus farming insects and has been repeatedly shown for fungus-farming ants and to a lesser degree also termites. Since the late 19th century it is only assumed for ambrosia beetles. Very little knowledge on the actual farming practices and the ability of ambrosia beetles to actively promote the growth of their food fungi over others is present. With the application of amplicon sequencing of the fungus garden microbiome a first step was attempted towards real evidence. We sequenced the fungal and bacterial community of Xyleborinus saxesenii galleries, which either had an active nest with beetles present or where foundresses had been removed after successful inoculation of the mutualist. Beetle presence benefitted the mutualistic food fungi and showed a higher relative abundance, whereas contaminating molds were reduced. Moreover, bacterial community had a lower diversity in their presence and revealed a vertical transmission of primary and secondary symbionts. Our findings verify the existence of active farm behaviour in these beetles and show the positive influence of an active nest with larvae and adults present. Though, the exact measures need further investigation.
